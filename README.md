# AWS EC2 Secure SSH and SFTP Server Configuration

## Objective

The AWS EC2 Secure SSH and SFTP Server Configuration project aims to use Amazon Web Service's (AWS) features, notably the EC2 and VPC, to create an externally facing Linux system. The primary goal of this project is to provide secure SSH and SFTP access, confine the user to the directory, and allow uploading and downloading files. This project is designed to emphasize server access security and better understand AWS configurations and management.

### Skills Learned
- Cloud Computing : Configuring and managing virtual servers on AWS EC2
- Networking and Security : Implementing SSH key-based authentication, firewall rules, and secure file transfer protocols
- User and Access Management : Configuring user permissions and access within the server
- Directory Confinement : Setting up chroot environment or directory access restrictions

### Tools Used

- AWS EC2 : Launching and managing virtual server instances
- AWS VPC : Setting up subnets, route tables, and security groups
- AWS Security Groups : Configuring firewall rules to restrict access to specific IP addresses and ports
- SSH (Secure Shell) : Securing remote access to the EC2 instance
- SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) : Securing file transfer
- IAM (Identifity and Access Management) : Managing user permissions and access within the server
- Shell Commands : Linux shell commands for user and file system management
